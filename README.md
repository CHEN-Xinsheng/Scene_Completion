An implementation of [Scene Completion Using Millions of Photographs, SIGGRAPH 2007](https://cacm.acm.org/research/scene-completion-using-millions-of-photographs/), using Graph-cut Algorithm ([Graphcut Textures: Image and Video Synthesis Using Graph Cuts](https://www.think-cell.com/assets/en/career/talks/pdf/think-cell_article_siggraph2003.pdf)), Poisson Blending ([Poisson Image Editing. P PÃ©rez et. al. SIGGRAPH 2003](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Perez03.pdf)) and Mean-Value Coordinate ([Coordinates for Instant Image Cloning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1576246.1531373)).

This is a course project of Media Computing (2023), Tsinghua University.
